# ShapeSpider experiment

## Setup:

The setup instructions pertain specifically to the lab computer, which already has everything

You need two components:
- MATLAB 2015b
  - If you open the start menu, you should see MATLAB 2015b (32-bit) in the pinned applications
  - The MATLAB script is C:\\Users\\UBC\\Documents\\MATLAB\\Rob_Test\\network_listening_test.m
  - Run the script

- ShapeSpider program
  - On the Desktop, there is a ShapeSpider program
  - Run (as of 02/16) ShapeSpider_RC2.exe (there may be later Release Candidates, which will simply have a larger number)

## Running experiment:

1. Start the MATLAB script first
1. Start ShapeSpider
1. MATLAB will be ask for the User ID. ShapeSpider may have a config file already set, so if you need to choose a configuration file, please click on the bottom left corner of the screen 10 times.
1. If you have configuration file you want to use, place it in C:\\Users\\UBC\\
